title: Intro?

What I seek is to understand the web to develop for it better. I got into this habit of watching amazing tech talks, and this will be a series of documenting what I learn. A reference, if I may. 

This is set up with Jekyll and Github Pages. The best thing about this is writing in Markdown - the developer way. Another plus about this setup is that it becomes easier to link the blog (hosted by Github) in my portfolio and not worry about hosting. But what I'm taking away the most from this is that it is alright to use existing boilerplate and not write code from scratch - specially during finals week! :P
